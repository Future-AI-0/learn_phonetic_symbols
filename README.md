🔊 Audio File Naming Convention
Phonemes like /i:/ should be converted to filenames like i_.mp3.

Naming rule: replace / : with _.

Examples:

Phoneme	File Name
/i:/	i_.mp3
/tʃ/	tʃ_.mp3
/əʊ/	əʊ_.mp3

📌 All audio files should be placed inside the audio/ folder.

🚀 How to Use
Clone the repository or download the files manually:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Add your .mp3 audio files to the audio/ folder (make sure they follow the naming convention).
